## General Information

- LendingClub case study includes details about all the customers including their financial transactions, it poses the challenges associated with defaulter. It covers the data collection, cleaning, formating and making it ready for applying the data functions to get the insights and improving the lending decisions and analyze the risk to reduce the loss.

- As part of EDA training this project assigned to understand various steps involved while taking business decissions.

- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
- The CSV is provided with the loan data of around 40K customers, it includes the credit history, financial transactions and other personal data.
 


## Conclusions

- Through the comprehensive EDA exercise on the case study, we have explored the essential steps in data understanding.
- By correctly identifying data quality issues, conducting thourough analysis and presenting actionable recommendations.
